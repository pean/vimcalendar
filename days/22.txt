:global/{pattern}/{command}

search for lines matching pattern and apply command
Ex: Delete all lines matching invoicing pattern with :global/invoicing/d

Bonus: Simply use g as a abbreviation for global

Bonus: vglobal (or short vg) runs command on all line that does not match pattern

Fun fact: This is were grep comes from. E.g g/re/p where re is short for regexp
and p short for print
