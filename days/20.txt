:s/{pattern}/{string}/

Replace pattern with replacement on the current line. Ex :s/foo/bar/

Bonus: s is a abbreviation for substitute

Bonus: To replace all strings matching pattern add g after the last /

Bonus: Use c together with g (like :s/foo/bar/gc) to show a yes/no confirmation
dialog for each match.

Bonus: If pattern is left out the last search pattern is used instead

Bonus: Use %s to apply the substitution on the hole file. Like :%s//foo/
